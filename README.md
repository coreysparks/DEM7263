# Demography 7263
Spatial Demography

Fall 2021

## Course Information
Mondays 6-8:30  
Instructor: Dr. Corey S. Sparks  
Office hours:  Monday afternoons, preferably by appointment

## Course Description:
Spatial data are ubiquitous in human population research, and the processes in population dynamics (fertility, mortality and migration) all have spatial components to them.  The goals of this course are to introduce students to the applications and usage of spatial statistics for population research.  This class will introduce students to literature on spatial demography, including contextual factors related to health, conceptual measures of space and place and Census geographies. This class will also have a large analytical component with topics to include global and local spatial autocorrelation and clustering, spatially autoregressive models, spatial generalized linear mixed models including treatment of Bayesian hierarchical models.
  

### Computer skills:
We will be using R. R is the language in which most research statisticians work and current methodological developments are being made, it is also free and can be used on any operating system. 

Please update your R version (4.1.1) to the latest release and update all your packages.

We will use R through Rstudio (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) and we will use Rpubs for turning in all assignments.

### RTools
You should also install the version 4.0 install of Rtools if you are a windows user.
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/
For those of you interested in R, I have published all of the examples from this class, and my other classes to my Rpubs site: http://rpubs.com/corey_sparks, so you can follow along with that stuff if you choose.

I will also post data and other resources to my Github repository https://github.com/coreysparks/DEM7093 

## R packages for the class
Copy and paste the following command in Rstudio to install the packages we will use in this class:

source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreysparks/Rcode/master/install_first_7263.R") 

In Rstudio. Please have these programs downloaded and installed prior to class.
